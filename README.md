## .NET WebAPI Supercharged with Structured Logging (Serilog & Seq)

This repository demonstrates a powerful approach to implementing structured logging in your .NET WebAPI application using Serilog and Seq. 

**Benefits:**

* **Structured Logging:** Serilog empowers you with rich and informative logging, enabling efficient analysis and searchability.
* **Centralized Log Management:** Seq provides a centralized hub for collecting and visualizing your logs, streamlining monitoring efforts.
* **Improved Debugging:** Gain deeper insights into your application's behavior, leading to faster debugging and troubleshooting.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```

2. **Prerequisites:**

   - .NET Core SDK (refer to official documentation for installation instructions: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download))
   - Seq server (download from [https://datalust.co/seq](https://datalust.co/seq))

3. **Configuration (Optional):**

   This repository includes example configuration files for Serilog and Seq. You can adapt these files to your specific environment and logging preferences.

4. **Running the Application:**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Sending Logs to Seq:**

   Configure your Seq server URL and API key in the configuration files to centralize your logs.

**Technology Stack:**

* .NET WebAPI
* Serilog
* Seq

**Further Customization:**

This example serves as a foundation for implementing Serilog and Seq in your WebAPI project. Feel free to explore the extensive features offered by both libraries to tailor the logging solution to your specific needs.
